<p>Important and previously unprocessed historical collections in the city of
Chicago are being made available to researchers through UNCAP, the Uncovering
New Chicago Archives Project.  This project improves access to important
archival collections at the University of Chicago while providing access to a
wide range of archives at other institutions as well. Institutions include the
DuSable Museum of African-American History; the Chicago Defender; the Chicago
Public Library, Carter G. Woodson Regional Library, Vivian G. Harsh Research
Collection of Afro-American History and Literature; and the South Side
Community Art Center. At the University of Chicago, the project includes
contemporary poetry collections and the Chicago Jazz Archive, both located in
the Special Collections Research Center of the University of Chicago
Library.</p>

<p>UNCAP builds and expands upon Mapping the Stacks, an archival project
created and directed by Jacqueline Goldsby since 2005, when she was Associate
Professor in English Language & Literature and the College of the University of
Chicago.  (Jacqueline Goldsby is now Associate Professor in the Department of
English at New York University.) Goldsby and a group of University of Chicago
students began working with manuscripts in the Harsh Collection and with the
DuSable Museum's manuscript and moving image archives. In January 2007, Mapping
the Stacks became part of UNCAP, which was funded through September 2010
by a grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.</p>

<p>University of Chicago students and faculty members worked collaboratively
through the end of 2009 with archivists at the University of Chicago, the
DuSable Museum and the Harsh Collection, in addition to the Chicago Defender.
Travis Jackson, Professor in Music at the University, and Robert von Hallberg,
the Helen A. Regenstein Professor in English Language &amp; Literature and the
College at the University, are providing guidance to the work on the Chicago
Jazz Archive and the contemporary poetry archive.</p>

<p>The final result of UNCAP's unique institutional collaboration will be
enhanced access to finding aids for the archival collections at all of the
participating institutions. UNCAP allows students, researchers and scholars at
the University of Chicago, in the Chicago community, and around the world to
discover new original historical sources in Chicago and make use of them for
research, teaching, and publication.</p>
