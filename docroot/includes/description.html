<p>Important and unique historical collections in the Chicago area are
being made more widely accessible to researchers through UNCAP, the
Uncovering Chicago Archives Project. UNCAP brings new visibility to
archival collections held by a collaborative group of Chicago
institutions: the Chicago Defender newspaper, the DuSable Museum of
African-American History, the Vivian G. Harsh Research Collection of
Afro-American History and Literature of the Chicago Public Library,
Northwestern University, the South Side Community Art Center, and the
University of Chicago.</p>

<p>UNCAP's unique institutional collaboration provides open public
access to online finding aids for hundreds of archival collections
documenting a wide range of topics, time periods, and geographical
areas.  Researchers can find primary archival sources on African
American history and culture, theater, jazz, urban sociology,
journalism, Native Americans, modern poetry, anthropology, African
studies, literature, criminology and legal studies, art and photography,
medical history, and the Manhattan Project, among many other subjects.

<p>UNCAP builds and expands upon <a
href="http://mts.lib.uchicago.edu/">Mapping the Stacks</a>, an archival
project launched in 2005 by Jacqueline Goldsby, then Associate Professor
in English Language &amp; Literature and the College of the University
of Chicago. In January 2007, Mapping the Stacks became part of UNCAP,
which was funded through September 2010 by a grant from the Andrew W.
Mellon Foundation.  Expansion and enhancement of the UNCAP website and
database are being made possible through the joint efforts of
Northwestern University and the University of Chicago.</p>
