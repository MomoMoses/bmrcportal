Woodson Regional Library, Vivian G. Harsh Research Collection of Afro-American
History and Literature</h3>

    <p><span class="snippet">The Harsh Collection is the oldest and largest
African American Studies repository in the Midwest.</span> The collection was
founded in 1932 by Vivian G.  Harsh, the first black librarian to head a branch
of the Chicago Public Library. Harsh was an activist in Carter G. Woodson's
Association for the Study of Negro Life and History, she actively sought
donations for the collection from scholars, writers, and community activists.
Originally housed at the Hall Branch of the Chicago Public Library, located in
the heart of the Bronzeville community, the Harsh Collection began life as the
"Special Negro Collection". In the 1930s and 1940s the collection became a
central meeting place and resource during the Chicago Renaissance. By 1975 the
collection was moved to the new Carter G. Woodson Regional Library, where it
was renamed in honor of Vivian G. Harsh.</p>

    <p>Today the Harsh Collection holds more than 75,000 books, many of them
rare, over 500 periodical titles, some 15,000 reels of microfilm, nearly 5,000
clipping files, and some 175 manuscript and archival collections.  Although the
holdings include materials on peoples of African descent across the United
States and throughout the Diaspora, the collection's primary focus is on
documenting all aspects of African American history and culture in Chicago and
the state of Illinois. The scope of the manuscript and archival holdings is
especially diverse; these holdings include significant resources in literature,
art, music, journalism, social science, civil rights activism, religion, law,
business, labor, the medical professions, and social clubs.  Chronologically,
the strength of the collection lies primarily in the period 1930 to 2000.</p>
