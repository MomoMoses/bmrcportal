    <p><span class="snippet">The Chicago Jazz Archive was founded in 1976 to
preserve materials on the birth and early growth of Chicago jazz.</span> Over
time, due in part to a relationship with the Jazz Institute of Chicago, the
collections have grown to span more than eight decades of Chicago and general
jazz history. The collections include recordings, publications, photographs,
articles, posters, programs, ticket stubs, and other ephemera of musicians,
clubs, record companies, and jazz organizations. In 2007-2008, the collections
of the Chicago Jazz Archive were transferred to the Special Collections
Research Center.  Chicago Jazz Archive manuscript and archival collections are
currently being processed as part of the Uncovering New Chicago Archives
Project (UNCAP), a three-year initiative funded by the Andrew W.  Mellon
Foundation. These changes will enable the Library to provide expanded access to
the Chicago Jazz Archive, utilizing the facilities, services, and staff of the
Special Collections Research Center.</p>
